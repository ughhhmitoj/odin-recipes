    <h2>What is Onion Pakora?</h2>
    <p>Onion Pakoda is a deep fried Indian snack of crispy and tasty onion fritters made with gram flour (besan), spices and herbs. Also called Onion Pakora these are a popular Indian street food as well. Like many Indian recipes, onion pakoda is made differently in various regions of India. It is one snack that is easy to prepare and tastes good too. I share two flavorful variants of the recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
            <li>400 grams onion</li>
            <li>3 chilli (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>few curry leaves (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp coriander (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 tsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>¼ tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>¼ tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>¼ tsp ajwain</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
            <li>¾ tsp salt</li>
            <li>1½ cup besan / gram flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice flour</li>
            <li>oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>        firstly, thinly slice the onions. make sure to slice of uniform thickness as it helps to fry easily.
            transfer the sliced onion into a large bowl. </li>
        <li>add 3 chilli, few curry leaves, 2 tbsp coriander, 1 tsp chilli powder, ¼ tsp turmeric, ¼ tsp cumin powder, ¼ tsp ajwain, 1 tsp ginger paste and ¾ tsp salt.</li>
        <li>squeeze and mix well making sure all the spices are well combined and onions release moisture.</li>
        <li>further add 1½ cup besan, ¼ cup rice flour and mix well.</li>
        <li>squeeze and mix without adding any water.</li>
        <li>the water in the onion is enough to form the dough. add more besan if required.</li>
        <li>now drop the dough into hot oil forming a random shape.</li>
        <li>fry on medium flame stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>fry until the pakoda turns golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>finally, drain off the pakoda and enjoy with hot tea.</li>
    </ol>
